# Software Requirements

## Vision

*What is the vision of this product?*

* To provide users with a unified, centralized place to keep track of all the shows/entertainment media they want to keep up with.

*What pain point does this project solve?*

* Not being able to remember all of the various entertainment media you want to engage with when you are ready to partake.

*Why should we care about your product?*

* Because we've all had the struggle of sitting down to watch a movie and not being able to think of one, or getting invested in a series and then forgetting to check for a new season the following year, finishing a book and not being able to remember the great novel that our friend recommended that we read next.

## Scope (In/Out)

IN - What will your product do?

* Describe the individual features that your product will do
* High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
*Example:*
  * *The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafes in the area*
  * *The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations*
  * *Users will be able to “Star” their favorite shops*
  * *Each shop will contain reviews of the customer’s experiences*

OUT - What will your product not do?

* These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

### Minimum Viable Product vs

* Home page with Welcome message to orient new users to the app
* About Us page with bios for the app authors
* Movies page with separate cards for each film you add
* Each card populates name, genre, release year, description, director from an API

### Stretch

* Track multiple types of entertainment media
  * Movies
  * TV Series
  * Music
  * Books
* Dedicted page for recommendations from friends

## Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

1. An admin can create and delete user accounts
2. A user can update their profile information
3. A user can search all of the products in the inventory

### Data Flow

Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

## Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)

Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

1. Security
2. Usability
3. Testability
4. etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You *MUST* describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is **NOT** acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
